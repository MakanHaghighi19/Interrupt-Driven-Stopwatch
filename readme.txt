EGEC 450 Lab 3 â€“ Interrupt-Driven Stopwatch

This embedded systems project implements a stopwatch with millisecond resolution using the Tiva-C microcontroller and a time-multiplexed seven-segment display. The system is fully interrupt-driven and was developed in C using Code Composer Studio. It was designed as part of the EGEC 450 Embedded Systems course at California State University, Fullerton.

Project Overview

Overview

The lab is divided into two parts:

1. Seven-Segment Display Driver
   - Drives a multi-digit seven-segment display using SPI.
   - Uses time-multiplexing to refresh digits.
   - Operates with timer-based interrupts.

2. Stopwatch System
   - Implements a stopwatch with a 1 ms resolution.
   - Controlled by three buttons (Start/Stop, Increment, Reset).
   - Stopwatch updates are interrupt-driven.

## Features

- Time-multiplexed seven-segment display
- Real-time stopwatch functionality with 1 ms resolution
- Button-based control using GPIO interrupts
- Display refresh and debounce logic using timers

## Hardware Requirements

- Tiva-C LaunchPad (TM4C123GH6PM)
- EduBase-V2 Trainer Board or compatible 7-segment SPI display
- Three push-buttons (external recommended)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
